UCI Bootcamp Homework Assignment #10

In this Assignment, we will be creating an Amazon type storefront using MySQL.  The App will take orders from customers
and deplete stock from the store's inventory.  If I get to the bonus, I will also track product sales across the  
store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.
